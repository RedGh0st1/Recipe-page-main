# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page Solution

![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge on Frontend Mentor. Building this project helped me improve my HTML, CSS, and responsive web design skills by developing a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing recipe page.


## The Challenge

The challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## My Process

  - Semantic HTML5 markup for structure
  - CSS custom properties for theme customization
  - Flexbox for layout design
  - Mobile-first workflow for responsive design
  - Vanilla JavaScript to enhance interactivity
  - Styled Components for consistent and reusable styling
  - Responsive images using different resolutions for optimal loading



## What I learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of instyling CSS and targetting individual grid but i still need more work. Here are a few things I found most valuable:

```html
 <h2
        style="
          color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
          margin-bottom: 10px;
          border-top: 3px solid hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
          padding: 10px;
        "
      >
        Instructions
      </h2>
      <ol style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <p style="font-weight: bold; display: inline; margin-bottom: 20px">
            Beat the eggs:
          </p>
          In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they
          are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a
          fluffier texture.
        </li>
```


## Continued Development

I realized I need to practice CSS more because it took me longer than expected to complete this challenge.

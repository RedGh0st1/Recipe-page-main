## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge on Frontend Mentor. Building this project helped me improve my HTML, CSS, and responsive web design skills by developing a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing recipe page.

## My Process



## What I learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of instyling CSS and targetting individual grid but i still need more work. Here are a few things I found most valuable:

## Sharing your solution

	I learned how to use CSS selectors more effectively. I used the GRID system and I had to remove the border from the last two elements and for that I had to use the nth-last-child selector as follows.

.recipe-card {
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border-radius: 20px;
}
